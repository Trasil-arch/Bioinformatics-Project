# Bioinformatics-Project

These scripts will be helpful for scientists, students, or that are aligning genes, searching through downloaded databases, and updating alignment files with new names and a list or report.

Update 1 (4/30/20): 
Prototype files are uploaded and available to look at and use. 
  name_append.py - requires file names to be input directly into the file under certain lines (look at comments above in the code)
  find_files.sh - requiers one file name change at line 10.
Code will be udpated and adjusted over time feel free to leave comments about improvements and recommended adjustments.
